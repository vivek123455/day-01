1.write a blog on difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?
Ans:HTTP stands for hyper text transfer protocol.The first version of http was called http1.1 .
    In 2015, a new version of http called HTTP2 was created.HTTP2 solves several problems that
    the creators of HTTP1.1 did not anticipate.HTTP2 is much faster and more efficient than 
    HTTP1.1 . HTTP1.1 loads resources one after the other,so if one resource cannot be loaded,
    it blocks all the other resources behind it. HTTP2 is able to use a single TCP connection
    to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.




2.write a blog about objects and its internal representation in javascript?
Ans:Objects in javascript is most important data type and forms the building blocks for modern
    javascript.objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these 
    primitive data types as well as reference data types.An object is a reference data type.
    variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that
    value.For example let create an object named my car and give it properties named make,
    model and year as follows

         var mycar = newobject();
         mycar.make = 'ford';
         mycar.model='mustang';
         mycar.year = 1969;
